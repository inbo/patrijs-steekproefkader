  "version": "2023.1",
  "description": "<p>Since 2008, partridge hunting in Flanders has been subject to a number of conditions. The first condition states compliance with an average density of at least 3 breeding pairs per 100 ha of open space. The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (<a href=\"https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en\">INBO<\/a>) is responsible for the calculation of these densities and advises the Agency for Nature and Forests (<a href=\"https://www.natuurenbos.be/\">ANB<\/a>) on this.<\/p> <p>This repository contains the source code to generate the layer with open space within <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5584203\">hunting grounds<\/a> in Flanders. The selection is based on relevant categories of the <a href=\"https://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap<\/a> information.<\/p> <p>We aim to make the layer reproducible by making the code publicly available under an open source license. The code itself requires only freeware open source software (<a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\">R<\/a> and <a href=\"https://qgis.org\">QGIS<\/a>). The OpenStreetMap database updates continuously. Rerunning the code on the current database might yield a different layer. Therefore we also republish the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5792948\">snapshot<\/a> of the OpenStreetMap data we used. When we need to update the open space layer, we will add an updated snapshot as a new version. Having both the code and the data available under version control, allows to recreate both the most recent version as any older version.<\/p>",
