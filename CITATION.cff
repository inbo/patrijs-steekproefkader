abstract: "Since 2008, partridge hunting in Flanders has been subject to a number
  of conditions.\nThe first condition states compliance with an average density of
  at least 3 breeding pairs per 100 ha of open space.\nThe Research Institute for
  Nature and Forest ([INBO](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en)) is responsible for
  the calculation of these densities and advises the Agency for Nature and Forests
  ([ANB](https://www.natuurenbos.be/)) on this.\n\nThis repository contains the source
  code to generate the layer with open space within [hunting grounds](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5584203)
  in Flanders.\nThe selection is based on relevant categories of the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org)
  information.\n\nWe aim to make the layer reproducible by making the code publicly
  available under an open source license.\nThe code itself requires only freeware
  open source software ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org)).\nThe
  OpenStreetMap database updates continuously.\nRerunning the code on the current
  database might yield a different layer.\nTherefore we also republish the [snapshot](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5792948)
  of the OpenStreetMap data we used.\nWhen we need to update the open space layer,
  we will add an updated snapshot as a new version.\nHaving both the code and the
  data available under version control, allows to recreate both the most recent version
  as any older version."
